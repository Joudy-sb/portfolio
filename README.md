# My Portfolio

Hello there, welcome to my portfolio website. The building of the website is still in progress but if you wish to see the current results, follow these steps:

_Prerequisites_:
Python 3.x

## Setup

*Step 0:* Open the terminal

*Step 1:* Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/Joudy-sb/portfolio.git`

*Step 2:* Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
To avoid conflicts with other Python projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### For Windows
`python -m venv venv`

`venv\Scripts\activate`

### For macOS/Linux
`python3 -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

*Step 3:* Install the dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated (if you're using one), install the required packages.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

*Step 4:* Run the website
After all dependencies are installed, you can run the app by executing the following command:

`python app.py`

The website will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default. 

P.S.: the website is not responsive yet and is only adaptable to laptops.

## ENJOYYY :))
